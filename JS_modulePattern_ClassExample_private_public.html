            * Class Example | Module Pattern | 
            * 
            * Definition of a Class: Group of objects, functions and variables, commonly used (intersection).
            * Definition of an Object: Group of properties and their values (like JSON).
            * 
            * Thus, a "CSS-class" is usually an object, because it is a group of properties. 
            * (CSS-functions are only the values of their properties.)
